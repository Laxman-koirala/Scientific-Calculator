 1. Aim of the App and reason behind choosing.
 2. Technologies going to use and why.
 3. Plan for the next two weeks.
# Aim and reason for choosing
The aim of this project is to develop fully functioning alternative to a calculator which design to calculate problems in science,    engineering, and mathematics and performs functions beyond addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More importantly, it can able to handle exponents, logarithms, and trig functions as well. 

I studied mathematics and also worked for a school as math teacher. i really enjoy number, so maybe that's exactly the reason to choose.
# Technologies going to use and why
 1. System Software - Android Studio
    Android Studio is Android's official IDE. It is purpose built for Android to accelerate your development and help you build the         highest-quality apps for every Android device. It offer tools custom-tailored for Android developers, including rich code editing,       debugging, testing, and profiling tools.
 2. Programming Language - Java
   - With Object oriented paradigms, it has many methods inbuilt to develop various application.
   - No threat to security because nothing gets executed outside the JVM.
   - Open source nature of java and android.
   - it can use for both front end and backend(Functionality).
 3. Firebase or SQL
   - for backend to store result in cloud
   
 # Plan for the next two weeks.
   First Week
